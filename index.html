<h1>Native american residential schools</h1>
<hr>
<h2>thesis statement</h2>

<P1>When the English colonists opened up the first residential<br> 
    school, they became responsible for breaching the human <br>
    rights of the whole Native American population. The abuse <br>that occurred 
    there slowly eradicated their right to practice <br>their
    culture, religion, speak their language, and essentially  
    <br>stripped them of their identities. Native peoples’ culture still <br>hasn’t recovered from years of being
     destroyed and forgotten, <br>and it will likely never be the same. </P1>

<h3>Backround</h3>
<p>The establishment of Indian residential schools was an attempt 
    <br>to assimilate Indigenous children into Euro-centric North American
     <br> culture, which began in the early 17th century when the first 
     <br>pilgrims began to colonize the states and canada. Relations 
     <br>between Natives and Colonizers were tense, and some attempt
     <br> at peace was made in the beginning, but lots of lives were
     <br> lost in the total of battles between Indians and Europeans.</p>

     <h4>Build Up</h4>
<p> The Civilization Fund Act, also known as the Indian Civilization Act, was an Act passed by the United States Congress on March 3, 1819. The Act encouraged activities of benevolent societies in providing education for Native Americans and authorized an annuity to stimulate the "civilization process".[1] Thomas L. McKenney lobbied Congress in support of the legislation. It was originally intended to support schools in native villages and areas, such as those established by religious missions.</p>
